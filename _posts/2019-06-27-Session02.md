### The First Project about Circuit

This is the first lab time during the courses. As a curious students, I have longed for it for a long time. Before the lab time, I was a little nervous but excited since I was going to finish the amazing project that I haven't done in the past. Bue just the unknown things made this attractive. Let's start with the easiest task-making a bulb shine.

After successfully making a rea bulb shine, I decided to added another green bulb in series. And in this series, there was a button which was below my finger since I was pressing it to connect the whole series. It's working like a switch. If I press it, both the bulb will shine. Otherwise, they have no light.

Later, I made a really big progress. I changed the circuit in series to circuit in parallel and added the third yellow bulb. At the same time, I removed the button since I was going to control these bulbs by programming. As you see, it's a easy program called blink. They shined for 1 second and thaen stopped working for 1 second.

At last, I finally finished my project. As I proposed, I gonna make a traffic light. As a result, I needed to let them shine at different times for various time. Because of the alternating, I needed to power them by different power supply. So accuatlly there are three circuit in a protoboard in this vedio. After programming, I succeeded to finishing my project today.
