<h3 style="color:Tomato;"> The First Project about Circuit</h3>

This is the first lab time during the courses. As a curious students, I have longed for it for a long time. Before the lab time, I was a little nervous but excited since I was going to finish the amazing project that I haven't done in the past. Bue just the unknown things made this attractive. Let's start with the easiest task-making a bulb shine.

After successfully making a rea bulb shine, I decided to added another green bulb in series. And in this series, there was a button which was below my finger since I was pressing it to connect the whole series. It's working like a switch. If I press it, both the bulb will shine. Otherwise, they have no light.

Later, I made a really big progress. I changed the circuit in series to circuit in parallel and added the third yellow bulb. At the same time, I removed the button since I was going to control these bulbs by programming. As you see, it's a easy program called blink. They shined for 1 second and thaen stopped working for 1 second.

At last, I finally finished my project. As I proposed, I gonna make a traffic light. As a result, I needed to let them shine at different times for various time. Because of the alternating, I needed to power them by different power supply. So accuatlly there are three circuit in a protoboard in this vedio. After programming, I succeeded to finishing my project today.

<h3 style="color:Pink;"> Measure voltage in a circuit with a multimeter and with Arduino analogRead</h3>

<h4 style="color:Purple;"> 1.With a multimeter</h4>

You can see the voltage decreases along the direction of the current. And different bulbs have various voltage since their colors are not the same, which means that they need to release different amount of energy during shining.

<h4 style="color:Purple;"> 2.With Arduino analogRead</h4>

You can see the number shown on the computer screen. 1023 represents 4.33v and 419 represents 2.11v in the picture above. 0 just represents that there is no bulbs or resistors remaining in the direction of current. The circuit diagram in the blackboard shows the decreasing of the voltage in a circuit.

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Ohm's Law</h3>
Since we've already measured the voltage in a circuit, we needed to figure out some physics principles behind it. That's Ohm's law.

<h3 style="color:Yellow;"> Summary:</h3>
In the lab time, I succeeded finishing my subject of a traffic light step by step. That's my first subject done by myself in my physics career in the lab. I was really excited and proud. And I really expect the next lab time.
In the class, the teacher leaded us to do some easy experiments to find out Ohm's law. The learning way was really different from the Chinese learning way. When I learnt the Ohm's law in China, I just needed to remember the formula written in the blackboard instead of doing experiment to find it. Honestly, I love American way much.I hope I could do well in the classes of next week.
