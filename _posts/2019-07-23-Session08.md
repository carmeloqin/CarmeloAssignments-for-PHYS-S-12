<h2 style="color:Orange;"> I.CNC Machining</h2>
In the class, the professor shows us a demo for CNC machining and asks us to model one before the lab time. Someone may confused about what is CNC machining. It's like drilling, laser cutter, and 3D printer. The reason is that it uses drills to cut the materials in three dimensions. Let's see my model and how the CNC machine works.

<h3 style="color:Red;"> Problem:</h3>
Because there are some features on my hammer, they requires really delicate drilling. That means that it will take a long time to make it but I only have limited time. If you have time to do that, you need to change to small drill and smaller stepover. The diameter of the drill I used is even bigger than the width of my pattern on the hammer so that the machine can only try to cut one pattern. You can see the difference between my model and project.

Another problem is similar to the former one. I used to build a more complicated model that even have a sign of flash and the names of Jonathan and me on the surface of the hammer. But when I show it to Nathan, he told me that it's may be a little tough for CNC machine. On one hand, it's hard for a drill with large diameter to cut letters which are very small. On the other hand, because there is a vacant space at the bottom of my model, I cannot do it with the CNC machine. The reason is that although CNC machine can operate in three dimension, it can only cut from up to down instead of cutting the buttom. As a result, I can only use 3D printer to print it. And some of the letters are still very hard to distinguish even though I use the 3D printer. You could see from the vedio below.
