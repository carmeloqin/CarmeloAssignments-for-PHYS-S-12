I made a traffic light on the protoboard on last week. On this week, I construct a traffic light for the prototyping and transplant the circuit on it. Also, I program the Arduino of the circuit so that the different LED of different colors will shine in turns. Now it's a real traffic light.

I made one of the cars in my traffic system by sawing, drilling, and laser cutting. The wheels were cut from the wood board by laser cutter. I plan to let the car move by connecting it with a pulley. In addition to, I changed the Arduino in my circuit from UNO to NANO and soldered the NANO. I did this because NANO is smaller so that I could combine it with the traffic light model more easily.

I'm thinking about how to start up my car and use what as a trigger. After comparing, I decide to use the photo transistor. The principle is that attaching the photo transistor in the same series as the DC Motor and attach a infra red LED in the series next to it. When the infra red LED shine and the photo transistor detects enough infra red light, the photo transistor will allow current to flow through the series to power the motor. And when it doesn't detect the infra red light, it won't allow current to go through so that the motor cannot work. I make a test with the blue LED as the replacement of motor on this week. You can see that when the green LED is shining, the blue LED is shining simultaneously.

Although I had a successful test with the LED for the trigger on the last week, I failed when I replaced the blue LED with the DC motor. It actually worked but the voltage was not high enough to power the motor. After consulting Rob, I attach the photo transistor and the DC motor in different series because the current in the series of photo transistor is too low to power the DC motor. Affter DC motor is attached to a different series, the serires will offer enough voltage to run the motor. I program the Arduino so that it knows when it should send a signal to the pin of motor to change its state to HIGH. Whether sending the signal or not depends on the reading of the AnalogRead. It will send the signal only when the reading is higher than 500.

I solve the problems of multi-tasking and the power for the car this week. You can see that there are two Arduinos in my lask week project because I didn't know how to run two loops simultaneously. After discussing with Nathan, I renew the program this week and combine the two circuits togther. Fortunately, it works. For the power for the car, I think using the pulley to pull the car is the safest plan. The car won't go into wrong direction or start up at wrong time for this plan.
