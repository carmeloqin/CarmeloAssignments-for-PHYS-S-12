### FINAL: TRAFFIC SYSTEM

**Final Project Proposal:**

Traffic system at a crossing

<p style="color:Orange;">路Two tfraffic lights</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">路Two motor cars</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">路Two Pulleys</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">路A board</p>

<h3 style="color:Aqua;"> For Final, July 5th</h3>
I made one of the cars in my traffic system by sawing, drilling, and laser cutting. The wheels were cut from the wood board by laser cutter. I plan to let the car move by connecting it with a pulley. In addition to, I changed the Arduino in my circuit from UNO to NANO and soldered the NANO. I did this because NANO is smaller so that I could combine it with the traffic light model more easily.
