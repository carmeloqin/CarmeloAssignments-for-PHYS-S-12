<h2 style="color:Purple;"> I. Laser Cutter</h2>
Since I've already done my prototying at last class, I gonna make my design from image to real construction. To do this thing, I need to use a really powerful machine-laser cutter. Let's show you a video to illustrate how the laser cutter works.

After viewing the video, now you must be clear about why I should consider the error during kurf when I made the rapid prototying. Because the laser cuts the cardboard by burning, it's reasonable that a little additional area will also be burned along the lines.

<h3 style="color:Red;"> The Project</h3>

I think you could see that it's a trafffic light in vertical direction right now. My project doesn't disappoint me. It looks like the same as the design. 

<h4 style="color:Green;"> But there is an episode during constructing</h4>

From this picture, you could see that I change the kits of the foundation. Because when I used the former kits to construct the foundation after cutting them, I found that it's too unstable to support the weight above it. As a result, after discussing with Somia, I decided to make the sockets deeper so that the kits could fit more. Fortunately, this modification worked.

<h2 style="color:Orange;"> II. Vinyl Cutter</h2>
Vinyl Cutter is a very convenient and interesting machine. You just need to upload a png image to it and then it will automatically calculate how to cut it. The interesting is that it could make stickers. And professor even stick the demo made by him to his own t-shirt~

<h3 style="color:Red;"> The Project</h3>
After viewing the demo, I use my own phone to make a design and use the Vinyl Cutter to cut it. I think it's a perfect debut so I stick it to my own computer.

<h2 style="color:Aqua;"> III.For Final</h2>
I made one of the cars in my traffic system by sawing and drilling. I plan to let it move by connecting it with a pulley. In addition to, I changed the Arduino in my circuit from UNO to NANO and soldered the NANO. I did this because NANO is smaller so that I could combine it with the traffic light model more easily.
