<h2 style="color:Tomato;"> I.Debut in Fusion 360</h2>

In the former class, we've already asked to download Fusion 360 to prepare for this class. At this time, the teacher taught us how to use Fusion 360 to do rapid prototying. 

Just like building the circuit, I learn to use Fusion step by step. First, we need to measure the materials that we gonna use. For cardboard, its thickness is 4.6mm.

Although the thickness of the cardboard is 4.6mm, the distance between the mirror line is only 4.3mm because you need to consider the error during kurf.

We do this procedure by extruding.

You could fit them together in Fusion 360 to see whether your designing elements could work or not. By this way, you could avoid some mistakes and waste.

This is a easy rapid prototying for one of my traffic lights in my final project. But now it's in a horrizontal direction.
<h2 style="color:Purple;"> II. Laser Cutter</h2>
Since I've already done my prototying at last class, I gonna make my design from image to real construction. To do this thing, I need to use a really powerful machine-laser cutter. Let's show you a video to illustrate how the laser cutter works.

After viewing the video, now you must be clear about why I should consider the error during kurf when I made the rapid prototying. Because the laser cuts the cardboard by burning, it's reasonable that a little additional area will also be burned along the lines.

<h3 style="color:Red;"> The Project</h3>

I think you could see that it's a trafffic light in vertical direction right now. My project doesn't disappoint me. It looks like the same as the design. 

<h4 style="color:Green;"> But there is an episode during constructing</h4>
<img src="4.jpeg" alt="Board Traces">
From this picture, you could see that I change the kits of the foundation. Because when I used the former kits to construct the foundation after cutting them, I found that it's too unstable to support the weight above it. As a result, after discussing with Somia, I decided to make the sockets deeper so that the kits could fit more. Fortunately, this modification worked.

<h2 style="color:Orange;"> III. Vinyl Cutter</h2>
Vinyl Cutter is a very convenient and interesting machine. You just need to upload a png image to it and then it will automatically calculate how to cut it. The interesting is that it could make stickers. And professor even stick the demo made by him to his own t-shirt~

<h3 style="color:Red;"> The Project</h3>
After viewing the demo, I use my own phone to make a design and use the Vinyl Cutter to cut it. I think it's a perfect debut so I stick it to my own computer.
