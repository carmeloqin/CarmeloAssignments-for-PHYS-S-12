### New Journey for Carmelo in Physics Career

Waiting for almost 2 months, I finally had the chance to take part into a such exciting physics course. In the past, I only learnt some theoretical physics in my school in China. But i really have plenty of chances to use many advanced facilities like 3D printers and laser cutters.

Today was actually a relaxing day. We didn't need to do some projects. All the things we did  were just learning about the safety requirements, visiting the lab, and setting up our own website, which is really novel for me since I never imagine that I could have my own website in one day.

Although it was just my first time to starting my own web, it's easier than I thought. I just needed to follow the instructions and click some buttons. Even so, I still be proud of myself since I finished sucesfully independently and even helped the student sitting next to me. 

Let's see some facilities that I saw today:
