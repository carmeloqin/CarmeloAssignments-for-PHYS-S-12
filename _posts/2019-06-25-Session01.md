### New Journey for Carmelo in Physics Career

Waiting for almost 2 months, I finally had the chance to take part into a such exciting physics course. In the past, I only learnt some theoretical physics in my school in China. But i really long to have chance to use the advanced facilities like 3D printers and laser cutters to do project in practice.

Today was absolutely a relaxing day. We didn't need to do any projects. All the things we did  were just learning about the safety requirements, visiting the lab, introducing ourselves and setting up our own website, which is really novel for me since I never imagine that I could have my own website in one day.

Although it was my first time to starting my own web, it's easier than I thought. I just needed to follow the instructions and click some buttons. Even so, I still be proud of myself since I finished sucesfully independently and even helped the student sitting next to me. 

# Follow my steps, I'll show you the classroom and the lab.
