<h2 style="color:Blue;"> I.Build the Prototypes</h2>

As you know, traffic light is part of my final project. So I choose to build a prototype of traffic light. In last class, you could see that I've already succeeded finishing the construction of traffic light. In the lab time, I'm going to integrate the circuit of the lights into the construction. For this procedure, you needed to do a lot of things:

<h4 style="color:Orange;"> Soldering</h4>

Soldering is a really important part during building circuit. It can help you prove the current could flow through the whole circuit and make elements more stable. I soldered both the cooper with the bulbs and the Aduino NANO.

<h4 style="color:Purple;"> Gluing</h4>

Gluing makes the construction more stable so that it could help you increase the support ability of your construction. I choose the school glue and hot glue to do the gluing.

<h2 style="color:Blue;"> II.Test another Prototype</h2>
Car is also a important part of my final project. In order to figure out the start-up function of my cars, I build this circuit to test the infra-red photo-transistor. The principle is that I gonna make the infra red bulb and the green bulb shine together. And when photo-transistor detects the infra red light, it will allow the current flow. As a result, when the green light shine, the car will start up.
