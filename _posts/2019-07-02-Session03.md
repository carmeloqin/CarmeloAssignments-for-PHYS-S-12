<h2 style="color:Tomato;"> Debut in Fusion 360</h2>

In the former class, we've already asked to download Fusion 360 to prepare for this class. At this time, the teacher taught us how to use Fusion 360 to do rapid prototying. 

Just like building the circuit, I learn to use Fusion step by step. First, we need to measure the materials that we gonna use. For cardboard, its thickness is 4.6mm.

Although the thickness of the cardboard is 4.6mm, the distance between the mirror line is only 4.3mm because you need to consider the error during kurf.

We do this procedure by extruding.

You could fit them together in Fusion 360 to see whether your designing elements could work or not. By this way, you could avoid some mistakes and waste.

This is a easy rapid prototying for one of my traffic lights in my final project. But now it's in a horrizontal direction.
