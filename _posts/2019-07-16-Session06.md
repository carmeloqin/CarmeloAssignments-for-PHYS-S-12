<h2 style="color:Orange;"> I.Demo of 3D Printing</h2>
Before this class, 3D printing is a term that only occurs in the news for me. But now, I can see dozens of projects of 3D printing and even operate the 3D printers by myself. I really appreciate this chance. For the demos, these two are my favorite. The left one is the mummy of ancient Egypt. That's really my interest because I really love history and advanture. On the right hand side, you could see two similar dices. They are actually the same in size and pattern. The only difference between them is the color. Because this is just a demo, it has not been processed yet. But after processing, they could even by the same in color and texture.

This demo is really a complicated project. You could see that it is constructed by a lot of twisting branches. When I rotate it, I find that it really looks like a tunnel between theoretical different spaces. That's why I love it! In addition to, for the dice demo, it is modeled by scanning. So a teacher of us is wondering that whether we could model this demo by scanning. Unfortunately, the scanner doesn't work. But I really want to see what will happen. That must be something interesting.

<h2 style="color:Green;"> II. Travelling in 3D Printing</h2>

<h3 style="color:Blue;"> 1.Deisgn</h3>
During the lab time, I make a model for CAMP NOU by fusion 360. Because I never make 3D design before, I meet some problems initially. For example, it's really hard to make the bleachers for the audiences of the stadium. I tried extrude and draft at first, but it doesn't work. Later, I use the rotate. But I can only build a stadium with a circle inside, that shape doesn't fit well for a soccer field. At the end, I finnally finish the construction of the body of the stadium by sweeping. By this way, I could sweep a sketch along a selected path, and I could design the path by myself. Luckily, it works. But later, I don't know how to add text to my stadium. This time, I google it and sucessfully deal with it. I think it's a cool project for a soccer fan especially FC Barcelona fans.

After modeling, I send my 3D sketch to Cura and it automatically help me calculate the time I need take to print it. Because I only have limited time, I have to contract my sketch to really small scale. It's only 20 percent of the size I design at first.
For this reason, there is a obvious flaw showing in the project. The texts I add on it can only be hardly distinguished. But fortunately, the most imporatnt part "CAMP NOU" is still clear enough. Let's see the process of 3D printing!

**THE TEXT ON THE BLEACHERS SHOULD BE "MES QUE UN CLUB"**

<h2 style="color:Purple;"> III. Scanning</h2>
As I mentioned, some of the projects are modeled by scanning them directly. Scanning a model is just like taking photo of them. The only different thing is scanner takes thousands photos in a second and combines them to generate the shape of the object. It's a really convenient and accurate way to make a model as the same as the object. The professor shows to us how to scan an object.

 And later, with the help of Karan, I successfully construct a model of myself. I think the man on the screen is exactly me.

<h2 style="color:Yellow;"> Summary</h2>
Before this class, I cannot imagine that I can operate the 3D printer in person. When I hear that I could print an object that as the same as I design, I immediately determine to print CAMP NOU. The reason is that this is the stadium of FC Barcelona, which is my favorite team, but I never be there before. So I really want it just be in front of me and feel how grand it is. And when I see my project, I'm really proud of myself. It just feels like that a dream come true. Although I never do this before, I think it's a pretty successful debut in 3D printing.

I hope my next step is to make it bigger and more real if I have enough time to print it. For example, I want to add the big screen and the pattern of soccer field in the stadium. At the same time, I need to solve the problem of the clearness of the words. The good news is that we could use the 3D printers whenever as long as we want. I really long to see my real CAMP NOU.
